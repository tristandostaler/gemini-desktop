# Gemini Client (Electron)
I've developed a straightforward desktop client for Gemini using the Electron framework.

Precompiled version for Windows is available for download here:
[Windows (Setup)](https://github.com/tristandostaler/gemini-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.0/Gemini.Desktop.Setup.1.0.0.exe)

For other systems, simply adapt and build the source code to suit your needs.

This client operates by utilizing a WebView container to access the Gemini website and implements various modifications for enhanced user experience.
With the shortcut Ctrl + G, Gemini can be opened from anywhere.
tip: use the installer and copy the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder.
